This project was completed after I learned the basics of Python.

Function description:
Pressing the 'run' button randomly selects several numbers (numbers that have been selected will not be chosen again until all numbers in the range have been picked).
Pressing the "clear" button will reset all numbers to be selectable again.
The selection range for the numbers can be determined from the 'from' and 'to' input fields (after setting 'from' or 'to', the function of the 'clear' button will be automatically executed).
The slider can be used to adjust the font size.
The button at the bottom controls whether to read out the results after the numbers are selected (if this feature is enabled, new numbers cannot be selected during the reading).
